        <p class="dropcap">Welcome to the Stephen Bickram online photography portfolio. The site is a small glimpse into the mind of a young artist who is beginning to hone his visual and graphic skills. The content is not a professional collection and should not be used as a professional portfolio.

        <h2>Creative Statement</h2>  
    
        <p>I’ve always been a strongly visual person who tended to stop and gaze with a great appreciation for visual beauty. Anything and everything from the stranger on the street, to the birds in the air, to the green of summer trees, holds a special and unique beauty which can evoke emotion. Although I never had access to much photography equipment or many artistic utilities growing up, I always found myself fixating on the visual and trying to capture the emotions it can carry. When I eventually did get my hands on a camera a few years ago, I found myself lost in a passion to capture the momentary feelings which visual images have always brought me.  
        </p>
   
        <p>The content of the following images varies, each one capturing a single momentary feeling .The following is a collection of personal pictures which have been put together over several years. The content of each image varies, each one attempting to capture and evoke a certain feeling. Each image is followed by a brief description of the shot’s content and concept.(click the arrow to reveal description)

        <h3> The White Dragon</h3>

        </figure>
        
        <p>This shot was alot of fun to create. I really tried to impart the ferocity of the character through Mike's expression and poster. The lighting of this shot was difficult to capture as the scene was laying horizontally on the floor, however patience paid off and it all came together.

        <p>I was lucky enough to have my brother help me out with this shot. He loves music of all types and easily loses himself in an instrument. It was my first real photo shoot and doing it my brother made it very easy to find the right shots.

        </figure>
    
        <p>This shot is styled for a guitar magazine cover. This was a really enjoyable shoot because of the massive tranformation in appearance of the model. When the model has a good time and enjoys the process it shows in the work.

        <h3>Hello Cupcake</h3> 
        <figure> 
            <img src="images/bickram.photo3.jpg" alt="Stephen Bickram Photo 3">
            <figcaption> Happy Birthday to me...</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p> This shot was alot of fun to create, and not just because I got cupcakes. Birthdays tend to have a variety of meanings to everyone. Some consider the passing of another year to be another sign of their life fading slowly, while others consider it a celebration of themselves. I felt the mixture of emotions and variety of views was best represented in simple terms.
